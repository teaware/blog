立秋词一首

> The traditional East Asian calendars divide a year into 24 solar terms. Lìqiū, Risshū, Ipchu, or Lập thu (Chinese and Japanese: 立秋; pinyin: lìqiū; rōmaji: risshū; Korean: 입추; romaja: ipchu; Vietnamese: lập thu; "start of autumn") is the 13th solar term. It begins when the Sun reaches the celestial longitude of 135° and ends when it reaches the longitude of 150°. It more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 135°. In the Gregorian calendar, it usually begins around August 7 and ends around August 23.

> Liqiu signifies the beginning of autumn in East Asian cultures.
